Tata Data Visualisation: Empowering Business with Effective Insights 

---These are the question which ask about online Retal Datasets ----

Question 1
The CEO of the retail store is interested to view the time series of the revenue data for the year 2011 only. He would like to view granular data by looking into revenue for each month. The CEO is interested in viewing the seasonal trends and wants to dig deeper into why these trends occur. This analysis will be helpful for the CEO to forecast for the next year.
Answers 
My analysis shows that the company generates the highest revenue during the months of September, October, November, and December. These five months consistently exhibit strong upward trends, contributing significantly to the overall annual revenue. This insight is critical for the company, as it highlights a clear seasonal pattern, which can be leveraged for better forecasting and strategic planning for the coming year!

Question 2
The CMO is interested in viewing the top 10 countries which are generating the highest revenue. Additionally, the CMO is also interested in viewing the quantity sold along with the revenue generated. The CMO does not want to have the United Kingdom in this visual.
Answers
My analysis reveals that the top 10 countries generating the highest revenue and quantity sold are the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, France, Australia, Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, Japan, and Belgium. These countries show strong performance in both revenue and quantity, offering valuable insights for strategic market focus. Notably, the United Kingdom has been excluded from this analysis as per the CMOâ€™s request
Quesion 3
The CMO of the online retail store wants to view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue. He is interested in a visual that shows the greatest revenue generating customer at the start and gradually declines to the lower revenue generating customers. The CMO wants to target the higher revenue generating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products.
Answer 3
My analysis identifies the top 10 customers by revenue, starting with Customer ID 14911, who generates the highest revenue. The visual representation shows a gradual decline from the top revenue-generating customer to the lower ones. This information is crucial for the CMO to focus on high-value customers, ensuring they remain satisfied with their products and continue contributing significantly to the company's revenue. Other notable customer IDs in this top 10 list include [mention a few more customer IDs, if needed], all of which represent key accounts for targeted retention efforts

Question 4
The CEO is looking to gain insights on the demand for their products. He wants to look at all countries and see which regions have the greatest demand for their products. Once the CEO gets an idea of the regions that have high demand, he will initiate an expansion strategy which will allow the company to target these areas and generate more business from these regions. He wants to view the entire data on a single view without the need to scroll or hover over the data points to identify the demand. There is no need to show data for the United Kingdom as the CEO is more interested in viewing the countries that have expansion opportunities
Answers 4
I created a tree map visual to provide a clear, single-view representation of product demand across all countries, excluding the United Kingdom as per the CEO's request. The tree map effectively highlights regions with the highest demand, with countries like the Netherlands, Ireland, France, Australia, and Germany showing significant demand for products. This visual provides a quick and comprehensive overview, which will support the CEO's expansion strategy by identifying regions with the greatest potential for growth."
